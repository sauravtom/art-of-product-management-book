# The Pre-Mortem Process

A pre-mortem is a powerful tool that helps teams identify potential issues and risks before they occur. By conducting a pre-mortem meeting early in a project's lifecycle, you can proactively mitigate problems and increase the likelihood of success. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to run an effective pre-mortem meeting with your team.

<Steps>

### Step 1: Invite the right people

Ensure that you include representatives from every function involved in the project, such as engineering, design, marketing, and customer support. For larger launches, consider holding separate pre-mortems for the product development and go-to-market aspects.

### Step 2: Set the stage with the pre-mortem prompt

Start the meeting by sharing the following prompt:

*"Imagine this project has failed six months from now. Let's work backwards from there and ask ourselves what went wrong and what could have contributed to this failure."*

This prompt creates psychological safety for team members to openly discuss their concerns and potential issues.

### Step 3: Provide quiet time for individual brainstorming

Give participants 5-10 minutes of quiet time to identify potential "tigers" (threats that could kill the project), "paper tigers" (seemingly threatening issues that aren't actually concerning), and "elephants" (important issues that no one is discussing). Have them enter their thoughts in a shared document without revealing them to others yet.

### Step 4: Share and discuss potential issues

Go around the room and have each team member share their identified tigers, paper tigers, and elephants. Encourage open discussion and ask participants to vote on the tigers they find most concerning, even if they didn't identify them themselves.

### Step 5: Prioritize and create an action plan

As the pre-mortem leader, it's your responsibility to prioritize the identified issues and create a post-pre-mortem action plan. Share this plan with the team and hold yourself accountable for making progress on the most critical items.

By following this process, you can uncover potential pitfalls that might otherwise go unnoticed until it's too late. The shared vocabulary of tigers, paper tigers, and elephants can help teams continue to discuss concerns openly throughout the project, leading to better outcomes.
