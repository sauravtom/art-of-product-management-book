# The LNO Framework for Prioritizing Tasks

As a product manager, you're constantly juggling a wide range of tasks and responsibilities. It can be challenging to determine which tasks deserve your immediate attention and which ones can be put on the backburner. This is where Shreyas Doshi's LNO Framework comes in handy. The LNO Framework is a system for categorizing tasks as high-leverage (L), neutral (N), or overhead (O) to optimize productivity and ensure you're focusing on the work that will have the greatest impact.

The LNO Framework helps you prioritize your tasks based on their potential impact, allowing you to make the most of your limited time and resources.

According to Shreyas, in a high-leverage role like product management, all tasks are not created equal. They can be divided into three categories:

1. **Leverage (L) Tasks**: These are tasks that provide a 10x or 100x return on the effort you put in. They have the potential to significantly move the needle for your product or company.

2. **Neutral (N) Tasks**: These tasks provide a return that is roughly equal to the effort invested. You put in 1x effort and get back 1.1x in value.

3. **Overhead (O) Tasks**: These are tasks where the return is much less than the effort you put in. They are necessary but don't directly contribute to your core goals.

The key insight of the LNO Framework is that in high-leverage roles, you should focus on tasks that minimize opportunity cost rather than just pursuing tasks with a positive ROI. This means prioritizing L tasks, being selective about N tasks, and minimizing O tasks as much as possible.

To apply the LNO Framework in your day-to-day work, you'll need to:

1. [Identify which tasks fall into each category](/lno-framework/high-leverage-tasks)
2. [Develop tactics for tackling high-leverage tasks](/lno-framework/high-leverage-tactics)
   
By mastering the LNO Framework, you'll be able to ruthlessly prioritize your work, ensuring that you're always focusing on the tasks that will have the greatest impact on your product and company. You'll be able to cut through the noise and distractions, and make meaningful progress on the things that truly matter.
