# Rethinking Prioritization: Minimizing Opportunity Cost

As product managers, we often find ourselves drowning in a sea of potential tasks and initiatives, each clamoring for our attention. The conventional wisdom is to prioritize based on return on investment (ROI), focusing on projects that deliver the most value for the least effort. However, Shreyas Doshi argues that this approach, while seemingly logical, can lead us astray.

Instead, Shreyas advocates for a different paradigm: **minimizing opportunity cost**. Rather than simply pursuing tasks with positive ROI, we should ask ourselves, "Is this the *best* use of my time?" By constantly seeking to minimize the gap between the value of our chosen actions and the value of the optimal actions we *could* be taking, we ensure that we're always working on the highest-impact initiatives.

Opportunity cost is the value of the optimal option minus the value of the chosen option. By minimizing this difference, we maximize the impact of our work.

This shift in mindset is especially crucial for those in high-leverage roles, like product management, where there are countless opportunities to create value. It's all too easy to fall into the trap of tackling quick wins and low-hanging fruit, feeling productive while missing out on the transformative projects that could reshape the trajectory of our products and businesses.

To illustrate this point, consider a hypothetical example:

> Imagine you're planning your roadmap for the next quarter. There are five well-defined features you could build, each offering a modest but clear improvement to the user experience. However, there are also two ambitious, less certain initiatives that could potentially redefine your product's value proposition and open up entirely new markets. If you prioritize based solely on ROI, you'll likely end up pursuing the five incremental features, as their outcomes are more predictable. But by doing so, you miss out on the opportunity to explore those game-changing ideas.

Adopting a mindset of minimizing opportunity cost doesn't mean abandoning ROI altogether. There's still a place for quick wins and iterative improvements. The key is to be intentional about how we allocate our time and resources, ensuring that we're not letting the allure of easy victories distract us from the transformative potential of more ambitious endeavors.

By embracing the principle of minimizing opportunity cost, we as product managers can ensure that we're consistently working on the initiatives that will have the greatest impact on our products, our users, and our businesses. It's a powerful lens through which to view prioritization, and one that can help us unlock the full potential of our roles as strategic leaders and value creators.
