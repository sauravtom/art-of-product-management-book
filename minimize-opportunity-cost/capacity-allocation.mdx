# A Recommended Approach for Allocating Team Capacity

As a product leader, it's crucial to strike the right balance when allocating your team's time and resources. Shreyas Doshi recommends the following rough percentage allocation for a team's capacity:

- **60% on Incremental Improvements:** These are high-ROI tasks that improve users' lives on a day-to-day basis.
- **30% on Big New Initiatives:** Dedicate a significant portion of your team's time to tackling one or two ambitious projects that could meaningfully change your business trajectory.
- **10% on Stability and Infrastructure:** Invest in maintaining and upgrading your product's foundation to ensure long-term success.

This allocation is a guideline, not a hard rule. Adjust the percentages based on your team's unique context, strategy, and market conditions.

## Communicating the Allocation to Your Team

When planning for the next quarter, half, or year, it's essential to provide clear guidance to your team about how they should allocate their time. Here's how you can communicate this effectively:

<Steps>

### Step 1: Clarify the Strategy

Ensure that you've already clarified the overall strategy, so your team has a solid foundation to base their planning on.

### Step 2: Share the Rough Allocation

Provide the rough percentage allocation as a guideline, explaining the rationale behind each category:

- Incremental Improvements (60%)
- Big New Initiatives (30%)
- Stability and Infrastructure (10%)

### Step 3: Encourage Team Planning

Ask your team to create their plans and proposals based on this rough guidance. Emphasize that the 30% allocated to big new initiatives should be focused on one or two projects, rather than spread thin across multiple initiatives.

### Step 4: Review and Refine

Review your team's plans and provide feedback to ensure alignment with the allocation guidance and overall strategy. Be open to adjusting the percentages if needed based on the team's input and unique circumstances.

</Steps>

By providing this clear guidance upfront, you empower your team to make informed decisions about where to focus their efforts. This approach helps ensure that your team is investing in the right mix of incremental improvements, ambitious bets, and long-term stability.

Regularly review and adapt your team's capacity allocation as your product, market, and strategic priorities evolve over time.
