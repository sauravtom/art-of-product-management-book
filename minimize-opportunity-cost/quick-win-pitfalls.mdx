# The Pitfalls of Over-Focusing on Quick Wins

As product managers, it's easy to fall into the trap of prioritizing tasks that provide a positive return on investment (ROI) but fail to move the needle in a significant way. These "quick wins" often feel satisfying in the moment, as they allow us to check items off our to-do lists and demonstrate tangible progress. However, an excessive focus on fast, incremental improvements can cause us to miss out on high-impact opportunities that require more time and effort to pursue.

## The Allure of Low-Hanging Fruit

When faced with a long list of potential initiatives, it's tempting to gravitate towards the low-hanging fruit - those tasks that are well-defined, easy to execute, and provide a clear positive ROI. These quick wins might include minor feature enhancements, bug fixes, or process optimizations. While these improvements are certainly valuable, they should not consume the majority of your team's time and energy.

## The Opportunity Cost of Playing It Safe

By consistently choosing the path of least resistance, you risk failing to invest in the bold bets that have the potential to truly transform your product and business. As [Shreyas Doshi argues](/minimize-opportunity-cost), product managers in high-leverage roles should focus on minimizing opportunity cost rather than just pursuing tasks with a positive ROI.

Consider the following scenario:
- Option A: Implement five small features, each with a clear positive ROI
- Option B: Tackle one ambitious project with the potential to significantly improve a key product metric, but with less certain outcomes

If you consistently choose Option A, you may miss out on the game-changing impact that Option B could deliver. While Option B carries more risk, it also offers the possibility of a much higher reward.

## Balancing Quick Wins and Ambitious Bets

This is not to say that quick wins have no place in your roadmap. Incremental improvements play an important role in continuously enhancing the user experience and maintaining momentum. The key is to strike the right balance between quick wins and more ambitious initiatives.

As [Shreyas recommends](/minimize-opportunity-cost/capacity-allocation), consider allocating your team's time as follows:
- 60% on incremental improvements
- 30% on big new initiatives (1-2 major projects)
- 10% on maintenance and bug fixes

By consciously carving out a significant portion of your capacity for bold bets, you ensure that you're not sacrificing long-term impact for short-term gains.

## Embracing Uncertainty

Pursuing high-impact opportunities often means venturing into uncharted territory, where the path to success is less clear-cut. As a product manager, it's essential to become comfortable with uncertainty and ambiguity. While it may feel safer to stick to well-defined, predictable tasks, the biggest rewards often lie in tackling complex, open-ended problems.

By consciously avoiding the pitfalls of over-focusing on quick wins, you can unlock the full potential of your product and team. Embrace a mindset of minimizing opportunity cost, balance incremental improvements with ambitious bets, and have the courage to pursue the initiatives that will truly move the needle.
