# Identifying the Root Cause of Execution Problems

As a product manager, you've likely encountered situations where your team is consistently facing execution challenges - missed deadlines, scope creep, or a lack of alignment. It's easy to attribute these issues to surface-level problems like poor time management or communication breakdowns. However, more often than not, **execution problems are actually symptoms of deeper strategic, cultural, or interpersonal issues**.

Shreyas Doshi, a prominent product management thought leader, emphasizes the importance of identifying the true root cause of recurring execution problems. He argues that by taking the time to diagnose the underlying issues, product managers can avoid the trap of constantly putting out fires and instead focus on solving the right problems.

When you find yourself repeatedly applying band-aid solutions to execution challenges, it's a strong signal that there may be a more fundamental issue at play.

Some common examples of execution problems that may have deeper roots include:

- **Team misalignment**: If two teams are constantly struggling to collaborate effectively, it could be a sign of a [strategy misalignment](/three-levels/aligning-levels), unclear priorities, or even interpersonal conflicts between team members.

- **Missed deadlines**: Consistently missing deadlines may indicate that the team is over-committing due to a lack of a clear [prioritization framework](/lno-framework), or that there are [cultural issues](/three-levels/optics-importance) incentivizing teams to take on more than they can handle.

- **Quality issues**: If the team is regularly shipping bugs or incomplete features, it could be a symptom of a [process problem](/pre-mortems/pre-mortem-process), [inadequate testing](/minimize-opportunity-cost/capacity-allocation), or a [skills gap](/root-cause/deeper-issues) on the team.

By proactively identifying the [signs of deeper issues](/root-cause/deeper-issues) and taking a systematic approach to [solving the right problem](/root-cause/right-problem), product managers can break the cycle of recurring execution challenges and unlock their team's full potential.

In the following subsections, we'll explore some specific strategies for spotting the warning signs of underlying issues and diagnosing the true root cause of your team's execution problems.
