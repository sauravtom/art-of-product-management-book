# Aligning on the Right Level

One of the most common sources of tension and conflict in product teams is when individuals or groups are operating at different levels of product work - impact, execution, or optics. As a PM, it's crucial to recognize these misalignments and take steps to get everyone on the same page.

## Identifying Misalignment

Here are some signs that your team may not be aligned on the right level:

- **Debating minutiae:** If you find yourself constantly arguing over small details without making progress on the bigger picture, it's a red flag that you're not aligned on the level of impact.
- **Lack of shared vocabulary:** When team members are using different terms or frameworks to discuss the work, it can indicate that you're not operating at the same level.
- **Mismatched priorities:** If one group is focused on hitting short-term execution goals while another is concerned with long-term impact, it's a clear sign of misalignment.

## Getting Aligned

So how do you get your team aligned on the right level? Here are some steps to follow:

<Steps>

### Step 1: Establish a shared vocabulary

Make sure everyone on the team understands the three levels of product work and has a clear definition for each. Encourage team members to use this vocabulary when discussing the work.

### Step 2: Clarify the context and goals

Explicitly communicate what level the team should be operating at given the current context and goals. For example, an early-stage startup may need to prioritize [execution](/three-levels#the-three-levels-of-product-work) over impact, while a mature product may need to focus more on impact and [optics](/three-levels/optics-importance).

### Step 3: Align incentives and rewards

Make sure your team's incentives and rewards are aligned with the desired level of product work. If you want the team to focus on impact, but their bonuses are tied to shipping features, you're sending mixed messages.

### Step 4: Lead by example

As the PM, you set the tone for the team. Consistently operate at the level you want the team to focus on, and gently redirect conversations when they veer off course.

## An Example

Let's say you're the PM for a mature B2B SaaS product. You've set a goal for the quarter to improve key customer retention metrics. However, in sprint planning, the engineering lead is focused on debating the technical details of the implementation, while the designer is concerned with the pixel-perfect UI.

To get aligned, you could:

1. Remind the team of the [three levels of product work](/three-levels#the-three-levels-of-product-work) and clarify that, given the goal, we need to operate at the level of impact.
2. Refocus the discussion on how the proposed work will measurably improve retention, not just on shipping the feature.
3. Celebrate and recognize team members who prioritize impact over just crossing tasks off the list.

By proactively aligning the team on the right level of product work for the context and goals, you can reduce friction, improve collaboration, and ultimately drive better outcomes for your product and users.
