# The Importance of Optics

In the [three levels of product work](/three-levels) - impact, execution, and optics - optics is often the most overlooked. However, investing time and effort into internal optics can greatly benefit your team and product in the long run.

## What are Internal Optics?

Internal optics refer to creating awareness and excitement about the impact and execution of your team's work within the organization. This can include:

- Sending out regular status updates
- Presenting progress and achievements at company meetings
- Sharing learnings and insights with other teams

## Benefits of Focusing on Optics

While it may seem like a distraction from "real work," investing in internal optics can lead to:

1. **Increased energy and motivation:** Sharing achievements and progress can boost team morale and keep everyone excited about the work they're doing.

2. **Valuable feedback opportunities:** By regularly communicating your team's work, you open the door for feedback and insights from other parts of the organization that can improve your product.

3. **Greater support and resources:** When leadership and other teams are aware of your team's impact, they may be more likely to provide additional support or resources when needed.

4. **Improved cross-functional collaboration:** Sharing learnings and insights can help break down silos and foster a culture of knowledge-sharing across the organization.

## Striking the Right Balance

While optics are important, it's crucial not to let them become the sole focus. As Shreyas notes:

> In certain organizations, that balance gets thrown off, where optics sometimes becomes the goal. It's not like the organization woke up in the morning and said this is the culture we want to create, it just happens again through little actions that occur every day.

To ensure optics don't overshadow impact and execution:

<Steps>

### Align on goals and priorities

Make sure your team is clear on the desired outcomes and prioritizes work that will have the greatest impact.

### Tie optics to impact and execution

When sharing updates or presenting work, always link it back to the impact it had or the challenges overcome in execution.

### Celebrate the right things

As a leader, be mindful of what you're praising in public forums. Balance recognizing individual achievements with the actual results and learnings.

</Steps>

By finding the right balance and incorporating optics into your team's regular practices, you can amplify the impact of your work and set your team up for long-term success.
