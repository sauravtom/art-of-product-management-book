# The Three Levels of Product Work

As a product manager, it's crucial to understand the interplay between the three key levels of product work: impact, execution, and optics. Recognizing these distinct levels and how they influence each other can help you navigate complex organizational dynamics, align with stakeholders, and drive successful outcomes for your product.

## Impact

At the highest level, product work is all about delivering **impact**. This means creating meaningful value for your users, your business, and potentially even society at large. Impact is the ultimate goal that should guide your decision-making and prioritization.

Examples of impact-driven product work include:

- Launching a new feature that addresses a critical user need and leads to increased engagement and retention
- Optimizing a key workflow to reduce friction and improve user satisfaction
- Expanding into a new market segment to drive business growth and revenue

## Execution

To achieve impact, you need to excel at **execution**. This level encompasses all the day-to-day activities, processes, and tactics required to bring your product vision to life. Execution is about getting things done efficiently and effectively, while maintaining high quality standards.

Examples of execution-focused product work include:

- Breaking down a complex feature into manageable tasks and dependencies
- Collaborating with engineering, design, and other cross-functional partners to deliver on time and within scope
- Continuously monitoring and iterating based on user feedback and metrics

## Optics

Finally, there's the level of **optics**, which is often overlooked but can be just as important as impact and execution. Optics refers to how your work is perceived and understood by others, both within your organization and externally. It's about creating visibility, alignment, and buy-in for your product initiatives.

Examples of optics-related product work include:

- Crafting compelling narratives and presentations to secure resources and support from leadership
- Regularly communicating progress, challenges, and wins to keep stakeholders informed and engaged
- Celebrating and promoting your team's successes to build momentum and credibility

Mastering the art of product management requires a keen awareness of how impact, execution, and optics intersect and influence each other. By operating effectively at all three levels, you can drive better outcomes and advance your career as a PM.

## Navigating the Levels

In practice, product managers often find themselves operating at different levels depending on the context and stakeholders involved. For example:

- When setting strategy with executive leadership, you may focus more on impact and high-level optics
- When working with your development team to ship a feature, execution will likely be your primary concern
- When presenting to other departments or external partners, optics may take center stage

The key is to recognize which level is most important in a given situation and adapt your approach accordingly. This requires a combination of strategic thinking, tactical expertise, and strong communication skills.
