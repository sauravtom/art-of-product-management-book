# The Importance of High Agency for PMs

As a product manager, you're constantly navigating a sea of challenges - from limited resources and technical hurdles to shifting priorities and stakeholder demands. In this environment, **high agency** is a critical trait that can make the difference between treading water and making meaningful progress.

## What is High Agency?

At its core, high agency is about **finding a way to achieve your goals, even in the face of adverse conditions**. It's a combination of several key qualities:

- **Ownership mindset**: Taking full responsibility for your product's success, rather than blaming external factors
- **Creative problem-solving**: Finding innovative solutions to overcome obstacles and constraints
- **Resilience**: Persevering through setbacks and learning from failures

PMs with high agency don't wait for perfect conditions to take action. They proactively seek out opportunities, rally support, and drive results.

## Why High Agency Matters

In the fast-paced world of product development, PMs with high agency stand out in several ways:

1. **They exceed expectations**. By consistently finding ways to deliver value despite challenges, high agency PMs build a track record of success that goes beyond their on-paper qualifications.

2. **They inspire their teams**. When a PM models ownership, creativity, and resilience, it sets a powerful example for the rest of the team to follow. This can foster a culture of proactivity and problem-solving.

3. **They drive outsized impact**. High agency PMs are more likely to tackle ambitious projects, seize untapped opportunities, and push through difficult initiatives that move the needle for the business.

## Cultivating High Agency

Developing high agency is an ongoing process, but here are some key ways to start building this muscle:

1. **Reframe obstacles as opportunities**. When faced with a challenge, ask yourself: "How can I use this constraint to drive creativity and focus?" Embrace the problem-solving process as a chance to learn and innovate.

2. **Bias toward action**. Don't get stuck in analysis paralysis. Identify the minimum viable action you can take to move forward, and iterate from there. Progress begets progress.

3. **Communicate proactively**. Don't wait for others to notice issues or roadblocks. Surface them early, along with proposed solutions. This demonstrates ownership and earns trust from stakeholders.

4. **Celebrate learning**. Reframe failures and setbacks as valuable lessons. Share these learnings openly with your team to foster a growth mindset and normalize iteration.

By intentionally practicing these habits, you'll build your capacity for high agency over time - and reap the rewards in your product management career.
