# Key Lessons from Top Tech Companies and Founders

Throughout his career, Shreyas Doshi has worked at some of the most influential tech companies, including Google, Twitter, Yahoo, and Stripe. During his time at these companies, he had the opportunity to learn valuable lessons from their founders and leadership teams. In this section, we'll explore some of the key insights Shreyas gleaned from his experiences.

## Google: Thinking Big and Simulating the Future

At Google, Shreyas learned the power of thinking really big. He observed that Google had a unique ability to pursue billion-dollar opportunities, even if they weren't immediately obvious. This mindset helped the company create innovative products and features, such as video ads, that significantly impacted their business.

Shreyas also noticed that Larry Page, one of Google's co-founders, had a remarkable ability to simulate the future and make better decisions based on that simulation. This strategic insight allowed Google to stay ahead of the curve and make bold moves in the industry.

## Twitter: The Power of Network Effects and Product Differentiation

Despite the challenges Twitter faced with infrastructure and leadership, Shreyas recognized the incredible staying power that comes from combining network effects with core product differentiation. He observed that there's still no product quite like Twitter, even years after its launch. This unique combination of factors has enabled Twitter to maintain its position in the market and remain relevant.

## Yahoo: The Importance of a Single User Account

During his time at Yahoo, Shreyas worked on the identity team and witnessed firsthand the power of building multiple services under a single user account. The "one Yahoo ID" concept was a game-changer, allowing users to access various services seamlessly. This experience taught Shreyas the value of creating a unified user experience across different products and services.

## Stripe: The Magic of High Energy, Sound Judgment, Low Ego, and Small Teams

At Stripe, Shreyas experienced the incredible impact of combining high energy, sound judgment, low ego, and small teams. He observed this combination more at Stripe than any other company he had worked for, and it left a lasting impression on him.

Shreyas also learned valuable lessons from Stripe's founders, Patrick and John Collison:

- From John, he learned the importance of effective marketing and how to talk about products in terms that resonate with customers.
- From Patrick, he learned how to think and communicate more clearly.
- From both founders, he learned the importance of setting the desired company culture by consistently exemplifying the behaviors they wanted to see in the organization.
