# Tactics for Tackling High-Leverage Tasks

As a product manager, it's crucial to focus your time and energy on high-leverage tasks that will have the greatest impact on your product and team. However, these tasks are often the most challenging and easiest to procrastinate on. Here are two tactics Shreyas Doshi recommends for overcoming procrastination and tackling high-leverage tasks:

## Placebo Productivity

Before diving into a high-leverage task, spend a couple of days intentionally filling your schedule with neutral and overhead tasks. This "placebo productivity" helps trick your brain into feeling accomplished and primes you to take on the more challenging, impactful work.

<Steps>

### Step 1

Identify your high-leverage task and set a target date to work on it.

### Step 2 

Fill the days leading up to your target date with neutral and overhead tasks from your to-do list.

### Step 3

Remind yourself that these tasks are simply "placebo productivity" to mentally prepare for the high-leverage task ahead.

### Step 4

On the appointed day, dive into your high-leverage task with a fresh mindset and sense of accomplishment.

## Change of Location

Another effective tactic for fighting procrastination on high-leverage tasks is to change your work environment. A new setting can provide a fresh perspective and help you focus without the distractions of your usual routine.

<Steps>

### Step 1

Identify a high-leverage task you've been procrastinating on.

### Step 2

Choose a different work location, such as a coffee shop, co-working space, or even a different room in your home or office.

### Step 3

Pack the essentials you need to work on the task, such as your laptop, notebook, or any relevant documents.

### Step 4

Head to your new work location and dive into the high-leverage task with renewed focus and energy.

</Steps>

By leveraging these tactics, you can overcome procrastination and ensure you're dedicating your time and attention to the work that will have the greatest impact on your product's success.
