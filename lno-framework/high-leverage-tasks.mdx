# Identifying High-Leverage Tasks

As a product manager, your time is precious, and it's crucial to focus on tasks that will have the greatest impact on your product and team. In the [LNO Framework](/lno-framework), high-leverage tasks are those that yield a disproportionately high return on investment in terms of value created relative to the time and effort put in.

## Characteristics of High-Leverage Tasks

High-leverage tasks often share the following qualities:

- They are **strategic** in nature and align with your product vision and goals
- They involve **decision-making** that will significantly influence the direction of your product or team
- They require **deep thinking** and problem-solving to tackle complex challenges
- They **unblock** or **enable** other important work streams
- They **create value** for users, the business, or your team in a meaningful way

## How to Identify High-Leverage Tasks

<Steps>

### Step 1: Reflect on your product vision and goals

Regularly revisit your product strategy and key objectives. Ask yourself: *"What are the most important things we need to achieve in the next quarter or year?"*

### Step 2: Consider your team's and users' biggest pain points

Identify the most pressing issues and challenges facing your team and users. These often point to areas where high-leverage work is needed.

### Step 3: Look for opportunities to unlock or accelerate impact

Proactively seek out projects and decisions that have the potential to create outsized value or unblock key initiatives. Don't just focus on incremental improvements.

### Step 4: Assess the potential impact and effort of each task

For each potential high-leverage task, roughly estimate the expected impact and the time and resources required. Prioritize tasks that offer the best ratio of impact to effort.

### Step 5: Regularly reassess and adapt

As your product and team evolve, so will your high-leverage tasks. Continuously reassess your priorities and be willing to adjust course as needed.
