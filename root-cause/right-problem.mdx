# Solving the Right Problem

When faced with recurring execution challenges, it's crucial to take a step back and identify the true root cause of the issue. By addressing the underlying problem, you can save your team valuable time and resources that would otherwise be wasted on temporary fixes.

Remember, band-aid solutions may provide temporary relief, but they won't prevent the same issues from resurfacing in the future.

To drill down to the core of your execution problems, consider the following approaches:

<Steps>

### Reflect on past solutions

Think about the solutions you've implemented in the past to address similar challenges. If you find yourself repeatedly applying the same fixes without seeing lasting results, it's a clear indication that you're not targeting the real problem.

### Engage in open dialogue

Encourage your team to have candid conversations about the obstacles they face. Create a safe space where everyone feels comfortable sharing their perspectives and concerns. Often, the people closest to the work have valuable insights into the true nature of the problem.

### Question your assumptions

Challenge the assumptions you're making about the cause of the issue. Ask yourself, "What if the opposite were true?" or "What evidence do I have to support this belief?" By questioning your assumptions, you may uncover blind spots or biases that are obscuring the real problem.

### Look for patterns

Analyze the situations where execution challenges arise. Are there any common denominators, such as specific team members, processes, or external factors? Identifying patterns can help you pinpoint the root cause more accurately.

### Seek outside perspectives

Sometimes, an outside viewpoint can provide clarity and help you see the problem in a new light. Consult with colleagues from other teams, mentors, or even external experts to gain fresh insights and alternative perspectives.

By investing time in identifying the true root cause of your execution problems, you can develop targeted solutions that address the underlying issues head-on. This proactive approach will help you break the cycle of recurring challenges and set your team up for long-term success.

Remember, as a product manager, it's your responsibility to ensure that your team is focusing their efforts on the right problems. By honing your problem-solving skills and fostering a culture of continuous improvement, you can lead your team to overcome even the most complex execution challenges.
