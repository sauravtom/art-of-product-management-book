# Signs of Deeper Issues

As a product manager, it's crucial to recognize when recurring execution problems may be symptomatic of deeper strategic, cultural, or interpersonal issues within your team or organization. By identifying these red flags early on, you can address the root causes and prevent them from derailing your product's success.

Here are some key signs that your execution challenges may have underlying causes:

## Recurring Band-Aid Solutions

If you find yourself repeatedly applying short-term fixes to the same problems without seeing lasting improvements, it's a clear indication that you're not addressing the fundamental issues at play. As Shreyas Doshi puts it, "a surefire way of identifying [problems that aren't actually execution problems] is when you put on a band-aid and the band-aid falls."

For example, if you're constantly adjusting processes or adding new meetings to improve communication between two misaligned teams, but the friction persists, there may be deeper strategic or cultural differences that need to be resolved.

## Lack of Clarity on Strategy

When teams are unclear about the overarching product strategy or have differing interpretations of it, execution problems are likely to follow. Without a shared understanding of the product vision and priorities, teams may work at cross-purposes or struggle to make decisions that align with the bigger picture.

## Misaligned Incentives

Execution issues can also arise when teams or individuals are incentivized to optimize for different things. For example, if one team is laser-focused on hitting their own KPIs while another is prioritizing a seamless customer experience, they may make decisions that are at odds with each other.

As a product leader, it's important to examine whether your organization's culture and reward systems are inadvertently encouraging siloed thinking or misaligned priorities.

## Persistent Interpersonal Friction

Sometimes, execution problems can be traced back to interpersonal dynamics between key stakeholders or team members. If two teams or individuals consistently butt heads or struggle to collaborate effectively, it can create bottlenecks and delays that hamper execution.

While it's tempting to attribute these challenges to personality differences, it's worth digging deeper to understand if there are underlying factors (such as competing priorities or unclear roles and responsibilities) that are fueling the conflict.

## The Unspoken Elephant in the Room

In some cases, the root cause of execution issues may be an uncomfortable truth that everyone is aware of but no one is openly discussing. This could be anything from a fundamental flaw in the product strategy to a key team member who is underperforming.

As a PM, it's crucial to create an environment where these "elephants in the room" can be safely surfaced and addressed head-on, rather than allowing them to fester and undermine execution.

By keeping an eye out for these warning signs and proactively investigating the underlying drivers of execution problems, you can steer your team toward more sustainable solutions. Remember, as tempting as it may be to reach for a quick fix, taking the time to diagnose and address the deeper issues is often the key to unlocking long-term product success.
